# Month 1 – Python Basics and Data Manipulation (Summary)

## Week 1: Introduction to Python Programming

**Theory ** Python is a high-level programming language that supports variables, data types, operators, conditions, and loops for controlling program flow. It provides the foundation for all advanced data science tasks.

**Concepts Learned:**

- Python variables, data types (int, float, str, bool).
- Operators: arithmetic, comparison, logical.
- Input/output functions (`input()`, `print()`).
- Conditional statements (`if`, `if-else`, `if-elif-else`).
- Loops: `for`, `while`, and use of `break`/`continue`.

**Hands-On Practice:**

- Wrote a temperature converter (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit).
- Implemented a basic calculator for arithmetic operations.

**Client Project:**

- Script to calculate average temperature from a list of values.

## Week 2: Data Structures and Functions

**Theory ** Data structures organize and store data efficiently, while functions help reuse logic and make code modular. Together, they allow scalable and structured programming.

**Concepts Learned:**

- Built-in collections: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets.
- Functions and parameters.
- Lambda (anonymous) functions for quick operations.
- Recursion (function calling itself).
- List comprehension for compact data transformations.

**Hands-On Practice:**

- Created a function for sum of squares of numbers.
- Filtered even numbers using list comprehension.

**Client Project:**

- Script for data cleaning: removed duplicates and filtered data above a threshold.
- Demonstrated recursion using factorial function.

## Week 3: NumPy and Pandas for Data Manipulation

**Theory ** NumPy provides powerful tools for numerical computation with arrays, while Pandas allows structured data manipulation using DataFrames and Series. They are the backbone of data analysis workflows.

**Concepts Learned:**

- NumPy arrays: creation, elementwise operations, broadcasting.
- Useful NumPy methods: `mean`, `sum`, vectorized computations.
- Pandas DataFrame and Series.
- Indexing, filtering, grouping, aggregation.

**Hands-On Practice:**

- Squared NumPy arrays and calculated mean.
- Used Pandas to drop missing values, group data, and calculate averages.

**Client Project:**

- Cleaned and aggregated a sample dataset by department.
- Calculated average salary per department after cleaning missing values.

## Week 4: Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

**Theory ** Data visualization helps interpret patterns, trends, and insights from data using graphical representations. Matplotlib and Seaborn are powerful Python libraries for creating informative plots.

**Concepts Learned:**

- Matplotlib basics: line, bar, histogram, scatter plots.
- Seaborn advanced visualizations: histplot, scatterplot, heatmap, pairplot.
- Customization: titles, labels, legends, color palettes.

**Hands-On Practice:**

- Created histograms for feature distributions.
- Visualized relationships using scatter plots.
- Used heatmaps to analyze correlation.

**Client Project:**

- Designed a dashboard-style visualization for the Iris dataset.
- Included histograms, scatter plots, correlation heatmap, and pairplots.

- Gained proficiency in Python basics, data structures, and functions.
- Practiced with NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.
- Learned to clean and aggregate datasets.
- Built data visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Completed mini-projects for each week, preparing me for real-world data tasks.
